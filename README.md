Welcome to my corner of GitHub. I'm a newcomer to the platform, currently focused on learning and setting up my development environment.

## 🚀 My Current Focus

I'm actively working on my **learning plan** and exploring new technologies. You can follow my progress in my main project repository:

*   **[learning-plan](https://github.com/mathenatwo/learning-plan)**: My personal roadmap and notes for learning new programming languages and tools.

## ⚙️ Configuration and Backup Repositories

I use GitHub to securely manage and track changes to my system configurations. These repositories are primarily for automated backup and version control, which is why they are kept private.

| Repository | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `dotfiles` | Configuration files for my primary computer system (e.g., shell, editor, and application settings). |
| `archie-configs` | Configuration files for my secondary computer system, "Archie." |

These repositories are automatically updated every two days if any changes are detected, ensuring I always have a recent backup of my environment.

## 🤝 Let's Connect

I'm always open to connecting with other developers and learners. Feel free to reach out!
